Zombie Proof Doors
==================

Zombie Proof Doors is a Datapack for Minecraft that prevents Zombies from intruding
into your buildings by breaking doors. Unlike many predecessors, it handles **all**
types of door-busting Zombies.

It works by calming the odd urge that Minecraft Zombies have to break doors when
the difficulty is set to Hard or Hardcore.

The following types of Zombies (and baby variants) will stop attacking doors:

* Zombie
* Husk
* Zombie Villager
* Drowned
* Zombified Piglin
