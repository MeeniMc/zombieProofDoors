Zombie Proof Doors
==================

Zombie Proof Doors is a Datapack for Minecraft that prevents Zombies from intruding
into your buildings by breaking doors. Unlike many predecessors, it handles **all**
types of door-busting Zombies.

It works by calming the odd urge that Minecraft Zombies have to break doors when
the difficulty is set to Hard or Hardcore.

Supported zombie
----------------

The following types of Zombies (and baby variants) will stop attacking doors:

* Zombie
* Husk
* Zombie Villager
* Drowned
* Zombified Piglin
